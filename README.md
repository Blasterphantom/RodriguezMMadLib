//Mini Challenge 5 - mad lib
//This program will ask the user 10 inputs in the form of nouns,
//adjectives, verbs etc. and output them in a story
//Peer Review - Brandon Le: Program works as intended and the story was nice. What I liked the most was the fact that every single line had data validation and it also worked for each one when . I
you entered a number it would ask for a word not a number. I didn't see data validation on every single line in other mad libs I saw so I appreciated that. If you hit enter and don't put anything at all it will skip to the next user input and leave those spots empty so it would be cool to see how he would stop that from happening. Good job overall. Very nice.
